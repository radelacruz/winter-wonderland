“You can’t buy happiness, but you can buy gelato and that’s kind of the same thing.”
We believe in the simple things that make you smile, sharing moments with family, catching up with old friends or making new ones…Life tastes better with gelato! Our artisan gelato makers are always churning freshly made gelato in-store, created with only the finest ingredients and the best part – with no artificial colours or flavours.

With a range of old-school classics to quirky flavours, choosing one is half the fun. Coffee lover at heart? Our café-style stores will ensure you can unwind with a barista-crafted espresso and spoilt-for-choice with waffles and cake slices.

So savour the moment at your local Gelatissimo and live deliciously.
